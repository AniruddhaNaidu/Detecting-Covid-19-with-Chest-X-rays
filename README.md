# University-Admission-Prediction
I have tested and evaluated models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forests and Support Vectorr Machines to predict how likely is a student to get admitted to a university
based on his scores and LOR, SOP
the best accuracy score I have got is 83.6% with Random Forest
